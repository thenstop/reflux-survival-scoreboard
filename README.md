# RefluxSurvivalScoreboard
This is a plugin I made for a (close to) vanilla server which needed a basic scoreboard.

- Shows TPS, fixes >20 TPS bug 
  - (technically not a bug but is due to certain circumstances and players would think it was weird)
- Shows current Phoenix Core rank
- Shows current playercount
